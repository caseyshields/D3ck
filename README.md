# D3CK

D3 Component Kit.

A collection of D3 UI components. Generated markup is clean, and styling is minimalist and interchangeable.

I recently realized I like writing D3 apps more than in any reactive, templated frameworks. Granted, I'm working at a ridiculously tiny scale, but I can't shake the feeling. Apart from being the defacto standard for web data visualization and inheritor of the protoviz library, D3 also has;
 
 - concise and powerful DOM manipulation
 - event dispatch utilities
 - state management tools
 - no aukward tooling chains or precompiling

I was able to rewrite my vue card deck components in a single sitting, and arrived at something much more concise.

TODO
 - investigate static site generation
 - use D3's state management
 - incorporate the rest of the D3 components I've made over the years.
